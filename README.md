# Dynamic Subword-incorporated Embeddings (DSE)
The source code for our paper "**Treat the Word As a Whole or Look Inside? Subword Embeddings Model Language Change and Typology**" accepted to the 1st International Workshop on Computational Approaches to Historical Language Change 2019.

## Abstract
We use a variant of word embedding model that incorporates subword information to characterize the degree of compositionality in lexical semantics.
Our models reveal some interesting yet contrastive patterns of long-term change in multiple languages: Indo-European languages put *more* weight on subword units in newer words, while conversely Chinese puts *less* weights on the subwords, but more weight on the word as a whole. 
Our method provides novel evidence and methodology that enriches existing theories in evolutionary linguistics. 
The resulting word vectors also has decent performance in NLP-related tasks.
